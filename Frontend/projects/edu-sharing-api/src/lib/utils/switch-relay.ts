 * Like `switchMap` followed by `shareReplay`, but does not emit old values to new subscribers while
 * the observable returned by `project` is in-flight.
 *
 * In other words, if an update was triggered by an emission of `source$` and a new subscriber comes
 * in, they won't get the previous value replayed. Instead, the first value they see is the result
 * of the projected observable once it emits. After that, everyone gets shared updates on newly
 * emitted values once they become available (like a normal `switchMap`-`shareReplay` combination).
