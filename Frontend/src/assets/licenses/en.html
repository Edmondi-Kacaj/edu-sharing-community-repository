This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with&#10;implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still&#10;does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.&#10;&#10;On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which&#10;avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate&#10;watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been&#10;specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much&#10;more than needed.&#10;&#10;## Getting started&#10;Install with npm:&#10;&#10;    npm install chokidar --save&#10;&#10;Then `require` and use it in your code:&#10;&#10;```javascript&#10;var chokidar = require(&#39;chokidar&#39;);&#10;&#10;// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles&#10;chokidar.watch(&#39;.&#39;, {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on(&#39;all&#39;, (event, path) =&gt; {&#10;  console.log(event, path);&#10;});&#10;```&#10;&#10;```javascript&#10;// Example of a more typical implementation structure:&#10;&#10;// Initialize watcher.&#10;var watcher = chokidar.watch(&#39;file, dir, glob, or array&#39;, {&#10;  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,&#10;  persistent: true&#10;});&#10;&#10;// Something to use when events are received.&#10;var log = console.log.bind(console);&#10;// Add event listeners.&#10;watcher&#10;  .on(&#39;add&#39;, path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been added`))&#10;  .on(&#39;change&#39;, path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been changed`))&#10;  .on(&#39;unlink&#39;, path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been removed`));&#10;&#10;// More possible events.&#10;watcher&#10;  .on(&#39;addDir&#39;, path =&gt; log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))&#10;  .on(&#39;unlinkDir&#39;, path =&gt; log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))&#10;  .on(&#39;error&#39;, error =&gt; log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))&#10;  .on(&#39;ready&#39;, () =&gt; log(&#39;Initial scan complete. Ready for changes&#39;))&#10;  .on(&#39;raw&#39;, (event, path, details) =&gt; {&#10;    log(&#39;Raw event info:&#39;, event, path, details);&#10;  });&#10;&#10;// &#39;add&#39;, &#39;addDir&#39; and &#39;change&#39; events also receive stat() results as second&#10;// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats&#10;watcher.on(&#39;change&#39;, (path, stats) =&gt; {&#10;  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);&#10;});&#10;&#10;// Watch new files.&#10;watcher.add(&#39;new-file&#39;);&#10;watcher.add([&#39;new-file-2&#39;, &#39;new-file-3&#39;, &#39;**/other-file*&#39;]);&#10;&#10;// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem&#10;var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();&#10;&#10;// Un-watch some files.&#10;watcher.unwatch(&#39;new-file*&#39;);&#10;&#10;// Stop watching.&#10;watcher.close();&#10;&#10;// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)&#10;chokidar.watch(&#39;file&#39;, {&#10;  persistent: true,&#10;&#10;  ignored: &#39;*.txt&#39;,&#10;  ignoreInitial: false,&#10;  followSymlinks: true,&#10;  cwd: &#39;.&#39;,&#10;  disableGlobbing: false,&#10;&#10;  usePolling: true,&#10;  interval: 100,&#10;  binaryInterval: 300,&#10;  alwaysStat: false,&#10;  depth: 99,&#10;  awaitWriteFinish: {&#10;    stabilityThreshold: 2000,&#10;    pollInterval: 100&#10;  },&#10;&#10;  ignorePermissionErrors: false,&#10;  atomic: true // or a custom &#39;atomicity delay&#39;, in milliseconds (default 100)&#10;});&#10;&#10;```&#10;&#10;## API&#10;&#10;`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`&#10;&#10;* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched&#10;recursively, or glob patterns.&#10;* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:&#10;&#10;#### Persistence&#10;&#10;* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process&#10;should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to&#10;`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted&#10;after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.&#10;&#10;#### Path filtering&#10;&#10;* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)&#10;Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is&#10;tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it&#10;gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second&#10;time with two arguments (the path and the&#10;[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)&#10;object of that path).&#10;* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while&#10;instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).&#10;* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the&#10;symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following&#10;the link references and bubbling events through the link&#39;s path.&#10;* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be&#10;derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.&#10;* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as&#10;literal path names, even if they look like globs.&#10;&#10;#### Performance&#10;&#10;* `usePolling` (default: `false`).&#10;Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling&#10;leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is&#10;typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over&#10;a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other&#10;non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on OS X overrides the&#10;`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable&#10;to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.&#10;* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)&#10;  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also &#10;    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.&#10;  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system&#10;  polling for binary files.&#10;  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))&#10;* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on OS X). Whether to use the&#10;`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly&#10;and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When&#10;set to `false` on OS X, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.&#10;* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the&#10;[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)&#10;object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set&#10;this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn&#39;t&#10;already available from the underlying watch events.&#10;* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of&#10;subdirectories will be traversed.&#10;* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).&#10;By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before&#10;the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`&#10;events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,&#10;especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the&#10;write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.&#10;Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,&#10;holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a&#10;configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily&#10;dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should&#10;be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.&#10;Use with caution.&#10;  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust&#10;  timing params:*&#10;  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in&#10;  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.&#10;  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.&#10;&#10;#### Errors&#10;* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files&#10;that don&#39;t have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`&#10;or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.&#10;* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).&#10;Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use&#10;&quot;atomic writes&quot; instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is&#10;re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event&#10;rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well&#10;for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in&#10;milliseconds.&#10;&#10;### Methods &amp; Events&#10;&#10;`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:&#10;&#10;* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.&#10;Takes an array of strings or just one string.&#10;* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.&#10;Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,&#10;`raw`, `error`.&#10;Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event&#10;name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.&#10;* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.&#10;Takes an array of strings or just one string.&#10;* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.&#10;* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file&#10;system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object&#39;s keys are all the&#10;directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the&#10;values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.&#10;&#10;## CLI&#10;&#10;If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out&#10;[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to&#10;execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.&#10;&#10;## Install Troubleshooting&#10;&#10;* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`&#10;  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is&#10;    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,&#10;    Chokidar should function properly.&#10;&#10;* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable &quot;python&quot; is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`&#10;  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:&#10;    `npm config set python python2.7`&#10;&#10;* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`&#10;  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools&#10;&#10;## License&#10;&#10;The MIT License (MIT)&#10;&#10;Copyright (c) 2016 Paul Miller (http://paulmillr.com) &amp; Elan Shanker&#10;&#10;Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy&#10;of this software and associated documentation files (the &ldquo;Software&rdquo;), to deal&#10;in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights&#10;to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell&#10;copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is&#10;furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:&#10;&#10;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in&#10;all copies or substantial portions of the Software.&#10;&#10;THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR&#10;IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,&#10;FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You want to make some light modifications to it - replacing a few characters here and there, wrapping it with a header and footer, etc - and ideally you&#39;d like to generate a source map at the end of it. You&#39;ve thought about using something like [recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast) (which allows you to generate an AST from some JavaScript, manipulate it, and reprint it with a sourcemap without losing your comments and formatting), but it seems like overkill for your needs (or maybe the source code isn&#39;t JavaScript).&#10;&#10;Your requirements are, frankly, rather niche. But they&#39;re requirements that I also have, and for which I made magic-string. It&#39;s a small, fast utility for manipulating strings and generating sourcemaps.&#10;&#10;## Installation&#10;&#10;magic-string works in both node.js and browser environments. For node, install with npm:&#10;&#10;```bash&#10;npm i magic-string&#10;```&#10;&#10;To use in browser, grab the [magic-string.umd.js](https://unpkg.com/magic-string/dist/magic-string.umd.js) file and add it to your page:&#10;&#10;```html&#10;&lt;script src=&#39;magic-string.umd.js&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#10;```&#10;&#10;(It also works with various module systems, if you prefer that sort of thing - it has a dependency on [vlq](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/vlq).)&#10;&#10;## Usage&#10;&#10;These examples assume you&#39;re in node.js, or something similar:&#10;&#10;```js&#10;var MagicString = require( &#39;magic-string&#39; );&#10;var s = new MagicString( &#39;problems = 99&#39; );&#10;&#10;s.overwrite( 0, 8, &#39;answer&#39; );&#10;s.toString(); // &#39;answer = 99&#39;&#10;&#10;s.overwrite( 11, 13, &#39;42&#39; ); // character indices always refer to the original string&#10;s.toString(); // &#39;answer = 42&#39;&#10;&#10;s.prepend( &#39;var &#39; ).append( &#39;;&#39; ); // most methods are chainable&#10;s.toString(); // &#39;var answer = 42;&#39;&#10;&#10;var map = s.generateMap({&#10;  source: &#39;source.js&#39;,&#10;  file: &#39;converted.js.map&#39;,&#10;  includeContent: true&#10;}); // generates a v3 sourcemap&#10;&#10;require( &#39;fs&#39; ).writeFile( &#39;converted.js&#39;, s.toString() );&#10;require( &#39;fs&#39; ).writeFile( &#39;converted.js.map&#39;, map.toString() );&#10;```&#10;&#10;You can pass an options argument:&#10;&#10;```js&#10;var s = new MagicString( someCode, {&#10;  // both these options will be used if you later&#10;  // call `bundle.addSource( s )` - see below&#10;  filename: &#39;foo.js&#39;,&#10;  indentExclusionRanges: [/*...*/]&#10;});&#10;```&#10;&#10;## Methods&#10;&#10;### s.addSourcemapLocation( index )&#10;&#10;Adds the specified character index (with respect to the original string) to sourcemap mappings, if `hires` is `false` (see below).&#10;&#10;### s.append( content )&#10;&#10;Appends the specified content to the end of the string. Returns `this`.&#10;&#10;### s.appendLeft( index, content )&#10;&#10;Appends the specified `content` at the `index` in the original string. If a range *ending* with `index` is subsequently moved, the insert will be moved with it. Returns `this`. See also `s.prependLeft(...)`.&#10;&#10;### s.appendRight( index, content )&#10;&#10;Appends the specified `content` at the `index` in the original string. If a range *starting* with `index` is subsequently moved, the insert will be moved with it. Returns `this`. See also `s.prependRight(...)`.&#10;&#10;### s.clone()&#10;&#10;Does what you&#39;d expect.&#10;&#10;### s.generateDecodedMap( options )&#10;&#10;Generates a sourcemap object with raw mappings in array form, rather than encoded as a string. See `generateMap` documentation below for options details. Useful if you need to manipulate the sourcemap further, but most of the time you will use `generateMap` instead.&#10;&#10;### s.generateMap( options )&#10;&#10;Generates a [version 3 sourcemap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit). All options are, well, optional:&#10;&#10;* `file` - the filename where you plan to write the sourcemap&#10;* `source` - the filename of the file containing the original source&#10;* `includeContent` - whether to include the original content in the map&#39;s `sourcesContent` array&#10;* `hires` - whether the mapping should be high-resolution. Hi-res mappings map every single character, meaning (for example) your devtools will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of function calls and so on. With lo-res mappings, devtools may only be able to identify the correct line - but they&#39;re quicker to generate and less bulky. If sourcemap locations have been specified with `s.addSourceMapLocation()`, they will be used here.&#10;&#10;The returned sourcemap has two (non-enumerable) methods attached for convenience:&#10;&#10;* `toString` - returns the equivalent of `JSON.stringify(map)`&#10;* `toUrl` - returns a DataURI containing the sourcemap. Useful for doing this sort of thing:&#10;&#10;```js&#10;code += &#39;\n//# sourceMappingURL=&#39; + map.toUrl();&#10;```&#10;&#10;### s.indent( prefix[, options] )&#10;&#10;Prefixes each line of the string with `prefix`. If `prefix` is not supplied, the indentation will be guessed from the original content, falling back to a single tab character. Returns `this`.&#10;&#10;The `options` argument can have an `exclude` property, which is an array of `[start, end]` character ranges. These ranges will be excluded from the indentation - useful for (e.g.) multiline strings.&#10;&#10;### s.insertLeft( index, content )&#10;&#10;**DEPRECATED** since 0.17 &ndash; use `s.appendLeft(...)` instead&#10;&#10;### s.insertRight( index, content )&#10;&#10;**DEPRECATED** since 0.17 &ndash; use `s.prependRight(...)` instead&#10;&#10;### s.locate( index )&#10;&#10;**DEPRECATED** since 0.10 &ndash; see [#30](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string/pull/30)&#10;&#10;### s.locateOrigin( index )&#10;&#10;**DEPRECATED** since 0.10 &ndash; see [#30](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string/pull/30)&#10;&#10;### s.move( start, end, newIndex )&#10;&#10;Moves the characters from `start` and `end` to `index`. Returns `this`.&#10;&#10;### s.overwrite( start, end, content[, options] )&#10;&#10;Replaces the characters from `start` to `end` with `content`. The same restrictions as `s.remove()` apply. Returns `this`.&#10;&#10;The fourth argument is optional. It can have a `storeName` property &mdash; if `true`, the original name will be stored for later inclusion in a sourcemap&#39;s `names` array &mdash; and a `contentOnly` property which determines whether only the content is overwritten, or anything that was appended/prepended to the range as well.&#10;&#10;### s.prepend( content )&#10;&#10;Prepends the string with the specified content. Returns `this`.&#10;&#10;### s.prependLeft ( index, content )&#10;&#10;Same as `s.appendLeft(...)`, except that the inserted content will go *before* any previous appends or prepends at `index`&#10;&#10;### s.prependRight ( index, content )&#10;&#10;Same as `s.appendRight(...)`, except that the inserted content will go *before* any previous appends or prepends at `index`&#10;&#10;### s.remove( start, end )&#10;&#10;Removes the characters from `start` to `end` (of the original string, **not** the generated string). Removing the same content twice, or making removals that partially overlap, will cause an error. Returns `this`.&#10;&#10;### s.slice( start, end )&#10;&#10;Returns the content of the generated string that corresponds to the slice between `start` and `end` of the original string. Throws error if the indices are for characters that were already removed.&#10;&#10;### s.snip( start, end )&#10;&#10;Returns a clone of `s`, with all content before the `start` and `end` characters of the original string removed.&#10;&#10;### s.toString()&#10;&#10;Returns the generated string.&#10;&#10;### s.trim([ charType ])&#10;&#10;Trims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the start and end. Returns `this`.&#10;&#10;### s.trimStart([ charType ])&#10;&#10;Trims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the start. Returns `this`.&#10;&#10;### s.trimEnd([ charType ])&#10;&#10;Trims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the end. Returns `this`.&#10;&#10;### s.trimLines()&#10;&#10;Removes empty lines from the start and end. Returns `this`.&#10;&#10;### s.isEmpty()&#10;&#10;Returns true if the resulting source is empty (disregarding white space).&#10;&#10;## Bundling&#10;&#10;To concatenate several sources, use `MagicString.Bundle`:&#10;&#10;```js&#10;var bundle = new MagicString.Bundle();&#10;&#10;bundle.addSource({&#10;  filename: &#39;foo.js&#39;,&#10;  content: new MagicString( &#39;var answer = 42;&#39; )&#10;});&#10;&#10;bundle.addSource({&#10;  filename: &#39;bar.js&#39;,&#10;  content: new MagicString( &#39;console.log( answer )&#39; )&#10;});&#10;&#10;// Advanced: a source can include an `indentExclusionRanges` property&#10;// alongside `filename` and `content`. This will be passed to `s.indent()`&#10;// - see documentation above&#10;&#10;bundle.indent() // optionally, pass an indent string, otherwise it will be guessed&#10;  .prepend( &#39;(function () {\n&#39; )&#10;  .append( &#39;}());&#39; );&#10;&#10;bundle.toString();&#10;// (function () {&#10;//   var answer = 42;&#10;//   console.log( answer );&#10;// }());&#10;&#10;// options are as per `s.generateMap()` above&#10;var map = bundle.generateMap({&#10;  file: &#39;bundle.js&#39;,&#10;  includeContent: true,&#10;  hires: true&#10;});&#10;```&#10;&#10;As an alternative syntax, if you a) don&#39;t have `filename` or `indentExclusionRanges` options, or b) passed those in when you used `new MagicString(...)`, you can simply pass the `MagicString` instance itself:&#10;&#10;```js&#10;var bundle = new MagicString.Bundle();&#10;var source = new MagicString( someCode, {&#10;  filename: &#39;foo.js&#39;&#10;});&#10;&#10;bundle.addSource( source );&#10;```&#10;&#10;## License&#10;&#10;MIT&#10;</pre

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#10;&#10;4.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#10;    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#10;    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#10;    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#10;    License.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#13;&#10;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#13;&#10;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#13;&#10;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#13;&#10;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#13;&#10;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#13;&#10;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#13;&#10;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#13;&#10;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#13;&#10;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#13;&#10;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#13;&#10;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#13;&#10;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#13;&#10;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#13;&#10;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#13;&#10;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#13;&#10;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#13;&#10;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#13;&#10;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#13;&#10;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#13;&#10;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#13;&#10;      replaced with your own identifying information.
